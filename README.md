# Horiseon Code Refactor Challenge

## Description

This project is a code refactor of the Horiseon website to improve accessibility and follow best practices for HTML structure. The goal of the challenge was to make the website more accessible for users with disabilities while maintaining its original design and functionality.

### Key Changes Implemented:

- Replaced non-semantic HTML elements with semantic elements (e.g., `div` to `header`, `section`, `footer`).
- Ensured all `img` elements have descriptive `alt` attributes for screen readers.
- Ensured that heading elements (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`.) follow a logical order to improve readability and accessibility.
- Added a more concise and descriptive `<title>` element.
- Consolidated and organized CSS to follow the semantic structure of the HTML.
- Improved the efficiency and maintainability of the CSS by removing duplicate and unnecessary styles.git
